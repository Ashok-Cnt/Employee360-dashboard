# Application Activity - Most Focused App Update

## Overview
Changed the Application Activity page metric from "**Top Used App**" to "**Most Focused App**" to better reflect the application with the highest focus time rather than total runtime.

**Date:** October 15, 2025

## Changes Made

### File Modified
**`frontend/src/pages/ApplicationActivity.js`**

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. State Variable Renamed
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const [topUsedApp, setTopUsedApp] = useState(null);

// AFTER:
const [mostFocusedApp, setMostFocusedApp] = useState(null);
```

### 2. Function Renamed and Logic Changed
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const calculateTopUsedApp = (apps) => {
  if (!apps || apps.length === 0) return null;
  
  // Find the app with the longest running time
  const topApp = apps.reduce((max, app) => {
    const currentRunTime = app.aggregates?.totalRunHours || 0;
    const maxRunTime = max.aggregates?.totalRunHours || 0;
    return currentRunTime > maxRunTime ? app : max;
  }, apps[0]);
  
  return topApp;
};

// AFTER:
const calculateMostFocusedApp = (apps) => {
  if (!apps || apps.length === 0) return null;
  
  // Find the app with the longest focus time
  const topApp = apps.reduce((max, app) => {
    const currentFocusTime = app.aggregates?.totalFocusHours || 0;
    const maxFocusTime = max.aggregates?.totalFocusHours || 0;
    return currentFocusTime > maxFocusTime ? app : max;
  }, apps[0]);
  
  return topApp;
};
```

### 3. Updated Function Call
```javascript
// BEFORE:
// Calculate top used app
const topApp = calculateTopUsedApp(data.apps);
setTopUsedApp(topApp);

// AFTER:
// Calculate most focused app
const topApp = calculateMostFocusedApp(data.apps);
setMostFocusedApp(topApp);
```

### 4. Updated Metric Card Display
```javascript
// BEFORE:
<Typography color="textSecondary" gutterBottom>
  Top Used App
</Typography>
<Typography variant="h6" noWrap sx={{ maxWidth: '200px' }}>
  {topUsedApp ? topUsedApp.title : 'N/A'}
</Typography>
<Typography variant="caption" color="textSecondary">
  {topUsedApp ? `${(topUsedApp.aggregates?.totalRunHours || 0).toFixed(1)}h` : 'No data'}
</Typography>

// AFTER:
<Typography color="textSecondary" gutterBottom>
  Most Focused App
</Typography>
<Typography variant="h6" noWrap sx={{ maxWidth: '200px' }}>
  {mostFocusedApp ? mostFocusedApp.title : 'N/A'}
</Typography>
<Typography variant="caption" color="textSecondary">
  {mostFocusedApp ? `${(mostFocusedApp.aggregates?.totalFocusHours || 0).toFixed(1)}h` : 'No data'}
</Typography>
```

## Key Differences

### Top Used App (OLD) vs Most Focused App (NEW)

| Aspect | Top Used App | Most Focused App |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Metric** | Total Runtime Hours | Total Focus Hours |
| **Data Field** | `totalRunHours` | `totalFocusHours` |
| **What it measures** | How long app was running | How long app had active focus |
| **Includes background time?** | Yes | No |
| **More accurate for productivity?** | No | Yes ✅ |

---

## Why This Change Matters

### ✅ More Meaningful Metric
- **Focus time** = Time when app was actively in the foreground
- **Runtime** = Total time app was open (including background)

### ✅ Better Productivity Insights
- Shows which app you're **actually working in**
- Not just which app is open in the background
- More relevant for productivity tracking

### ✅ Example Scenario
```
Scenario: Visual Studio Code running all day

OLD METRIC (Top Used App - Runtime):
- VS Code: 8.0h (running in background)
- Actual work might be much less

NEW METRIC (Most Focused App - Focus Time):
- VS Code: 3.2h (actual focused work time)
- More accurate representation of activity
```

## Visual Changes

### Metric Card (2nd Card in Overview Stats)

#### Before:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 💻                     │
│ Top Used App           │
│ Visual Studio Code     │
│ 8.0h                   │ ← Total runtime
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### After:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 💻                     │
│ Most Focused App       │
│ Visual Studio Code     │
│ 3.2h                   │ ← Focus time only
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## Data Source

### Backend API: `/api/activity/today`

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "title": "Visual Studio Code",
      "name": "Code.exe",
      "category": "Productive",
      "aggregates": {
        "totalRunHours": 8.0,      // Total time running
        "totalFocusHours": 3.2,    // Total time focused ← Used now
        "totalRunCount": 1,
        "avgMemoryUsageMB": 450.5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Calculation Logic

### Algorithm
1. Filter apps array (exclude background_apps)
2. Compare `totalFocusHours` for each app
3. Return app with highest focus time
4. Display app name and focus hours

### Code Flow
```
fetchApplicationSummary()
    ↓
calculateMostFocusedApp(data.apps)
    ↓
    For each app:
    - Get totalFocusHours from aggregates
    - Compare with current max
    - Return app with highest focus time
    ↓
setMostFocusedApp(result)
    ↓
Display in metric card
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ No Apps
- Shows "N/A" for app name
- Shows "No data" for hours

### ✅ No Focus Time
- Defaults to 0 hours
- Still shows app name

### ✅ Multiple Apps with Same Focus Time
- Returns first encountered (from reduce)
- Consistent behavior

### ✅ Background Apps
- Excluded from calculation
- Focus on user-interactive apps only

## Benefits of This Change

### 1. **More Accurate Productivity Tracking**
   - Focus time = actual work time
   - Runtime = may include idle background time

### 2. **Better User Insights**
   - Users see which app they're **actively working in**
   - Not misled by long-running background processes

### 3. **Aligns with Other Metrics**
   - Consistent with focus-based tracking
   - Matches hourly focus statistics

### 4. **Real-World Example**
   ```
   User has Chrome open all day with 50 tabs:
   - Runtime: 9 hours
   - Focus time: 1.5 hours (actual browsing)
   
   Most Focused App shows the realistic 1.5h
   ```

## Related Metrics

The Application Activity page now tracks:

1. **Active Applications** - Count of running apps
2. **Most Focused App** - App with highest focus hours ⭐ (NEW)
3. **System Memory** - Total memory usage
4. **Total Monitoring** - Total tracking time

All metrics focus on **active engagement** rather than passive runtime.

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Show Top 3 Focused Apps** - List instead of single app
2. **Focus Time Percentage** - Show as % of total monitoring time
3. **Focus Trend** - Up/down indicator vs yesterday
4. **Category Badge** - Show app category (Productive/Communication/etc)
5. **Click to Filter** - Click card to filter tables by that app

## Summary

✅ **Changed:** "Top Used App" (runtime-based)  
⭐ **To:** "Most Focused App" (focus-time-based)  
📊 **Metric:** `totalRunHours` → `totalFocusHours`  
💡 **Benefit:** More accurate productivity insights  

**Status:** Complete ✅  
**Build Status:** No errors ✅
