# Weekly and Monthly View Feature - Work Pattern Analysis

## Overview
Enhanced the date filter to support **Daily**, **Weekly**, and **Monthly** views, allowing users to analyze aggregated activity data across different time periods.

## New Features

### 1. View Mode Selection
Users can switch between three view modes:

#### ðŸ“… Daily View
- View activity for a single day
- Real-time data for today
- Historical data for past dates
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds (today only)

#### ðŸ“Š Weekly View
- Aggregated data for a full week (Monday-Sunday)
- Dropdown shows all available weeks
- Format: "Oct 14 - Oct 20, 2024"
- Combines data from all 7 days

#### ðŸ“ˆ Monthly View
- Aggregated data for an entire month
- Dropdown shows all available months
- Format: "October 2024"
- Combines data from all days in the month

### 2. Smart Data Aggregation

#### How Weekly Data is Calculated
```javascript
// For each app across the week:
- Total focus time = Sum of all days' focus time
- Total running time = Sum of all days' running time
- Peak memory = Maximum across all days
- Focus switches = Combined from all days

// For hourly summary:
- Each hour shows AVERAGE across the week
- Example: 09:00 shows avg productivity for 09:00 across Mon-Sun
```

#### How Monthly Data is Calculated
```javascript
// Same aggregation logic as weekly, but across all days in month
- Apps: Cumulative totals for the entire month
- Hours: Average activity per hour across all days
- System: Total monitoring hours, avg CPU, etc.
```

### 3. Visual Indicators

#### Mode Chips
- **Daily**: "Live Data" (green) or "Historical Data" (gray)
- **Weekly**: "Weekly Aggregated Data" (blue)
- **Monthly**: "Monthly Aggregated Data" (purple)

#### Additional Info
- Shows date range for weekly view
- Shows month name for monthly view
- Auto-refresh indicator (daily today only)

## Technical Implementation

### State Variables Added
```javascript
const [dateFilterMode, setDateFilterMode] = React.useState('daily');
const [selectedWeek, setSelectedWeek] = React.useState('');
const [selectedMonth, setSelectedMonth] = React.useState('');
const [weeklyData, setWeeklyData] = React.useState(null);
const [monthlyData, setMonthlyData] = React.useState(null);
```

### Helper Functions

#### 1. getWeekRange()
Calculates Monday-Sunday range for any date:
```javascript
Input: '2024-10-18'
Output: {
  start: '2024-10-14',  // Monday
  end: '2024-10-20',     // Sunday
  label: 'Oct 14 - Oct 20, 2024'
}
```

#### 2. getMonthRange()
Calculates first and last day of month:
```javascript
Input: (2024, 10)  // October
Output: {
  start: '2024-10-01',
  end: '2024-10-31',
  label: 'October 2024'
}
```

#### 3. getWeekOptions (memoized)
Generates unique weeks from available dates:
```javascript
const getWeekOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
  // Extracts all unique weeks from available dates
  // Sorted newest to oldest
  // Returns array of week objects
}, [availableDates]);
```

#### 4. getMonthOptions (memoized)
Generates unique months from available dates:
```javascript
const getMonthOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
  // Extracts all unique months from available dates
  // Sorted newest to oldest
  // Returns array of month objects
}, [availableDates]);
```

### Data Fetching Functions

#### fetchRangeData()
Fetches and aggregates data for a date range:
```javascript
const fetchRangeData = async (startDate, endDate) => {
  // 1. Loop through each day in range
  for (let d = start; d <= end; d++) {
    // 2. Fetch daily data for each day
    const data = await fetch(`/api/activity/daily-summary/${date}`);
    allData.push(data);
  }
  
  // 3. Aggregate all days into single dataset
  const aggregated = aggregateMultipleDays(allData);
  setActivityData(aggregated);
};
```

#### aggregateMultipleDays()
Combines data from multiple days:
```javascript
const aggregateMultipleDays = (daysData) => {
  // System Aggregation
  - Sum: monitoring hours, productive hours, idle hours
  - Average: CPU usage
  
  // Apps Aggregation
  - Sum: focus time, running time for each app
  - Max: peak memory
  - Combine: focus switches
  
  // Hourly Summary Aggregation
  - Average: each hour's activity across all days
  
  return aggregatedData;
};
```

### UI Component Structure

```jsx
<Paper>
  {/* Mode Toggle Buttons */}
  <Box>
    <Button>ðŸ“… Daily</Button>

    // Date dropdown + date picker + status chips
  )}
  
  {dateFilterMode === 'weekly' && (
    // Week dropdown + status chip
  )}
  
  {dateFilterMode === 'monthly' && (
    // Month dropdown + status chip
  )}
</Paper>
```

## Charts Behavior

### Work Pattern Chart (Pie/Doughnut)
- **Daily**: Shows single day's distribution
- **Weekly**: Shows total hours across week
- **Monthly**: Shows total hours across month

### Category Focus Chart (Stacked Bar)
- **Daily**: Hour-by-hour breakdown
- **Weekly**: Average per hour across 7 days
- **Monthly**: Average per hour across all days

### Time Distribution Chart (Doughnut)
- **Daily**: Single day's category breakdown
- **Weekly**: Total time per category for week
- **Monthly**: Total time per category for month

### Heatmap
- **Daily**: 24-hour intensity map
- **Weekly**: Average intensity per hour
- **Monthly**: Average intensity per hour

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Times
- **Daily**: Fast (1 API call)
- **Weekly**: Moderate (7 API calls)
- **Monthly**: Slower (up to 31 API calls)

### Optimization
- Requests run sequentially (could be parallelized)
- Failed requests are skipped (no error for missing days)
- Data is cached in state until filter changes

### Future Improvements
1. **Backend aggregation**: Add `/api/activity/weekly/:week` endpoint
2. **Parallel fetching**: Use `Promise.all()` for faster loading
3. **Caching**: Store fetched weeks/months in local storage
4. **Pagination**: Load months with many days in batches

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Flexible Analysis**: Choose granularity (day/week/month)
2. **Trend Identification**: See patterns across time
3. **Productivity Reports**: Generate weekly/monthly summaries
4. **Comparison**: Compare different weeks or months
5. **Planning**: Review past periods for better planning

### For Management
1. **Team Reports**: Aggregate team activity weekly/monthly
2. **Performance Metrics**: Monthly productivity statistics
3. **Trends**: Identify productivity patterns
4. **Insights**: Understand work habits over time
