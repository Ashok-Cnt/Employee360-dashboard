### Track Project Time
**Goal:** How long on Employee360 today?  
**Steps:** Focus Work → VS Code → Employee360  
**Result:** Total time + module breakdown

### Find Context Switches
**Goal:** Which file did I switch to most?  
**Steps:** Focus Work → App → Project → Check switches  
**Result:** File with highest switch count

### Analyze Distribution
**Goal:** How is time split across projects?  
**Steps:** Focus Work → App → View all projects  
**Result:** Time per project comparison

### Identify Time Sinks
**Goal:** Which file took most time?  
**Steps:** Drill to modules → Sort by time  
**Result:** Top time-consuming file

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App not clickable?
**Reason:** No focus switch data  
**Solution:** Normal - app wasn't focused

### Wrong project name?
**Reason:** Window title format not recognized  
**Solution:** Check "No Project" section

### Missing modules?
**Reason:** Not enough focus switches recorded  
**Solution:** Work on files longer for tracking

### Time seems off?
**Reason:** Only counts active focus time  
**Solution:** Expected - excludes background time
