# üéâ PROBLEM SOLVED: Data is Now Loading!

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed

Your Employee360 dashboard wasn't showing data because the backend was looking for files with the wrong username.

### Root Cause
- **Your JSONL files:** `activity_2025-10-15_GBS05262.jsonl`
- **Backend was looking for:** `activity_2025-10-15_Admin.jsonl`
- **Result:** File not found ‚Üí No data displayed

### Solution Applied
Added `USER_ID=GBS05262` to your `.env` file so the backend now looks for the correct files.

## üß™ Test Your Setup

### 1. Test Backend API
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
# Test if backend is responding
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/health"

# Test if data is being loaded
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activity/today"

# Test current snapshot
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activity/current"
```

### 2. Test Frontend
- Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
- Navigate to "Application Activity" page
- You should see your running applications
- Check that "Visual Studio Code" shows as most focused

### 3. Verify Data Collection
Check that the data collector is generating files:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "c:\Users\Gbs05262\HackathonWorkSpace\Employee360-dashboard\data-collector\activity_data" -Filter "*GBS05262*"
```

## üîß Configuration Files Updated

### `backend-express/.env`
```env
# User ID Configuration
USER_ID=GBS05262

# Data Directory
DATA_DIR=../data-collector/activity_data

# MongoDB Configuration
USE_LOCAL_DB=false
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://employee360:admin@employee360.n05xtqd.mongodb.net/
ATLAS_DATABASE_NAME=employee360

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Wait for Frontend:** Give it 30-60 seconds to compile
2. **Open Browser:** Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Navigate:** Click "Application Activity" in the sidebar
4. **Verify:** You should see all your running apps with metrics

### Ongoing Usage
1. **Keep Collector Running:** Ensure data collector is always active
2. **Monitor Data:** Check dashboard regularly for insights
3. **Review Charts:** Use hourly charts to analyze productivity patterns
4. **Track Focus:** Monitor which apps you focus on most

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Data Still Doesn't Appear

#### 1. Check Backend Status
```powershell
# Should return "healthy"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/health"
```

#### 2. Check if JSONL File Exists
```powershell
$today = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
Test-Path "c:\Users\Gbs05262\HackathonWorkSpace\Employee360-dashboard\data-collector\activity_data\activity_${today}_GBS05262.jsonl"
```

#### 3. Verify Data Collector is Running
- Check for Python process running the collector
- Look for PowerShell window with collector output

#### 4. Check Browser Console
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for errors
- Look for failed API requests in Network tab

#### 5. Hard Refresh Frontend
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` to force reload
- Or clear browser cache
