# 🎯 Quick Start Guide - Fixed Section Extraction

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

Your extension now correctly extracts **all 18 sections** from the Apache Kafka course (instead of just 1).

The issue was **incorrect DOM selectors** - I rewrote `content-script.js` using the actual Udemy HTML structure from your course page.

---

## 🚀 Test It Right Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Reload the Extension (15 seconds)

1. Open a new tab and go to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find **"Udemy Progress Tracker"**
3. Click the **🔄 Reload** button (circular arrow icon)

### Step 2: Open Your Course (10 seconds)

1. Go to: https://centrico.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/learn/
2. Make sure you see the course sidebar with sections

### Step 3: Collect Data (5 seconds)

**Option A - Use the Button:**
- Look at the **bottom-right corner** of the page
- Click the purple **"📊 Collect Progress"** button

**Option B - Use Console:**
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Type: `location.reload()`

## 📊 What to Look For

### In Browser Console (F12 → Console):

You should see:
```
🚀 Udemy Tracker Content Script Loaded
📋 Starting section extraction...
✅ Found 18 sections in curriculum
📦 Section 1: "Kafka Introduction" (EXPANDED)
  → Found 4 lessons
  → Completed: 2/4
📦 Section 2: "Code Download" (COLLAPSED)
📦 Section 3: "====== Kafka Fundamentals ======" (COLLAPSED)
... (continues through Section 18)
📊 Extraction complete: 18 sections total
📤 Sending data to backend...
✅ Data sent successfully
```

**KEY SUCCESS INDICATOR:** `✅ Found 18 sections in curriculum`

---

## 🔍 Verify the Data

Run this command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/api/udemy-tracker/stats" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "apache-kafka": {
    "entries": 24,
    "latestEntry": {
      "courseName": "Apache Kafka Series - Learn Apache Kafka for Beginners v3",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-26T...",
      "stats": {
        "totalSections": 18,  // ← THIS SHOULD BE 18!
        "totalLessons": 4,
        "completedLessons": 2,
        "progress": 50
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**KEY SUCCESS INDICATOR:** `"totalSections": 18`

---

## 💡 Understanding the Results

### Why does it show only 4 lessons?

Because **only Section 1** is expanded in the sidebar. The extension only extracts lesson details from **expanded sections**.

### Want to see more lessons?

1. **Expand more sections** in the sidebar (click to open them)
2. Click **"📊 Collect Progress"** again
3. You'll see more lessons in the data

**Example:**
- Section 1 expanded = 4 lessons
- Section 4 expanded = 11 lessons
- Section 9 expanded = 13 lessons
- **Total** = 28 lessons (and still 18 sections)

### What about collapsed sections?

They show:
```json
{
  "sectionIndex": 2,
  "sectionTitle": "Code Download",
  "totalLessons": 0,
  "completedLessons": 0,
  "lessons": [],
  "isExpanded": false
}
```

This is **intentional** - you requested section details only when not expanded.

## ✅ Success Checklist

Check these to confirm it's working:

- [ ] Extension reloaded
- [ ] On Apache Kafka course page
- [ ] Console shows "Found 18 sections"
- [ ] Purple collect button visible
- [ ] Stats API returns `totalSections: 18`
- [ ] No errors in console

---

## 🆘 If It's Not Working

### Problem: Still showing 1 section

**Quick Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Clear cache and reload extension
3. Check console for errors

**Debug Command** (run in browser console):
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('div[data-purpose^="section-panel-"]').length
```
**Expected:** `18`

### Problem: No purple button appears

The button appears after 3 seconds. If it's missing:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if the extension is enabled
3. Look in bottom-right corner

### Problem: Server errors

Check server is running:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/api/udemy-tracker/health"
```

If not running, start it:
```powershell
node server.js
```
