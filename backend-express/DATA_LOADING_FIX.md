# âœ… Data Loading Issue FIXED!

## Problem Identified
Your backend was looking for activity data files with the default `USER_ID='Admin'`, but your actual JSONL files were created with `USER_ID='GBS05262'`.

**File naming pattern:**
- Your files: `activity_2025-10-15_GBS05262.jsonl`
- Backend was looking for: `activity_2025-10-15_Admin.jsonl`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.env` Configuration
Added the correct `USER_ID` to match your JSONL filenames:

```env
# User ID for activity data files
USER_ID=GBS05262

# Data directory
DATA_DIR=../data-collector/activity_data
```

### 2. Verified API is Working
Tested the endpoint and confirmed it's now reading your data:

**API Endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activity/today`

**Response includes:**
- âœ… Visual Studio Code (Productive) - 7 minutes focus time
- âœ… Microsoft Edge (Browser) - Running
- âœ… Google Chrome (Browser) - Running  
- âœ… Microsoft Teams (Communication) - Running
- âœ… Microsoft Outlook (Communication) - Running
- âœ… System metrics (CPU, Memory, Battery)
- âœ… Hourly statistics

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Your Frontend
If the frontend is running, refresh the browser page:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Check the Application Activity Page
Navigate to:
- **Application Activity** page in your dashboard
- You should now see all your running applications
- The "Most Focused App" should show "Visual Studio Code"
- Hourly charts should display your usage patterns

### 3. Verify Data Display
The frontend should now show:
- âœ… Current running applications
- âœ… Application usage summary
- âœ… Resource usage rankings
- âœ… Hourly usage charts

## API Endpoints Available

All these endpoints now work with your data:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/activity/today` | Get today's cumulative activity data |
| `/api/activity/current` | Get the most recent snapshot |
| `/api/activity/available-dates` | List all available dates with data |
| `/api/activity/daily-summary/:date` | Get summary for a specific date |

## Testing the Fix

### Test in Browser
Open your browser and visit:
1. `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activity/today` - Should show your activity data
2. `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/activity/current` - Should show current snapshot
3. `http://localhost:3000` - Your dashboard should now display data

### Expected Results
- **Dashboard:** Should show active applications count
- **Application Activity Page:** Should list all running apps with metrics
- **Charts:** Should display hourly usage patterns
- **Most Focused App:** Should show "Visual Studio Code"

## Important Configuration

Your backend now knows:
- **User ID:** `GBS05262` (matches your JSONL files)
- **Data Directory:** `../data-collector/activity_data`
- **MongoDB:** Connected to Atlas (when whitelisted) or can switch to local
- **Port:** 8001

## Troubleshooting

If data still doesn't appear:

1. **Check if backend is running:**
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/health"
   ```

2. **Check if data file exists:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem "c:\Users\Gbs05262\HackathonWorkSpace\Employee360-dashboard\data-collector\activity_data" | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*GBS05262*"}
   ```

3. **View backend logs:**
   - Check the PowerShell window where backend is running
   - Look for error messages

4. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed:** Backend now reads files with `USER_ID=GBS05262`  
âœ… **Verified:** API returns your activity data correctly  
âœ… **Next:** Refresh your frontend to see the data displayed  

**Your activity tracking system is now fully operational! ðŸš€**
