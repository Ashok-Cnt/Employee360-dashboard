# ✅ DATA COLLECTOR FIXED - All Apps Now Detected!

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Your data collector was only showing 5-6 applications in the dashboard, but you had many more running:
- ❌ **Missing:** IntelliJ IDEA, mPuTTY, OneNote, SQL Developer, Bruno
- ✅ **Showing:** Only VS Code, Edge, Chrome, Teams, Outlook

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Missing App Categories
Many productivity tools weren't in the `APP_CATEGORIES` dictionary:
```python
# Before - Missing apps
'Productive': [
    'Visual Studio Code', 'IntelliJ IDEA', 'PyCharm', ...
    # ❌ Missing: SQL Developer, Bruno, OneNote, mPuTTY, etc.
]
```

### Issue #2: Wrong Visibility Logic
The collector was hiding apps if they were:
- Not visible in taskbar (even if categorized)
- Marked as "Uncategorized"

```python
# Old Logic (WRONG)
if category == 'Uncategorized':
    background_apps.append(app_data)  # Hide it!
elif is_visible or is_focused:
    taskbar_apps.append(app_data)     # Show it
else:
    background_apps.append(app_data)  # Hide it!
```

**Result:** IntelliJ, SQL Developer, Bruno, etc. were being hidden even though they're productive apps!

---

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### Fix #1: Added Missing Applications

Updated `APP_CATEGORIES` to include ALL your productivity tools:

```python
'Productive': [
    # Existing apps...
    'Visual Studio Code', 'IntelliJ IDEA', 'PyCharm', 'WebStorm',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: Database Tools
    'SQL Developer', 'Oracle SQL Developer', 'DBeaver', 'DataGrip',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: API Testing
    'Bruno', 'Insomnia', 'Postman',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: Note Taking
    'OneNote', 'Microsoft OneNote', 'Evernote', 'Notion', 'Obsidian',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: Terminal/SSH Tools
    'PuTTY', 'mPuTTY', 'KiTTY', 'MobaXterm', 'SecureCRT',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: Version Control
    'Git', 'GitHub Desktop', 'GitKraken', 'SourceTree',
    
    # ✅ ADDED: File Transfer
    'FileZilla', 'WinSCP'
]
```

### Fix #2: Improved Visibility Logic

Changed the logic to **show ALL categorized apps**, regardless of taskbar visibility:

```python
# New Logic (CORRECT)
if category == 'Uncategorized' and not is_visible and not is_focused:
    # Only hide truly unknown background processes
    background_apps.append(app_data)
else:
    # ✅ Show ALL categorized apps (Productive, Communication, Browsers, etc.)
    # Even if they're not currently visible in taskbar
    taskbar_apps.append(app_data)
```

**Result:** All your productive apps will now appear in the dashboard!
