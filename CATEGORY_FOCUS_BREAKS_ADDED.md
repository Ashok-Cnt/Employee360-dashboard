# Category-wise Focus Hours - Breaks Added

## Overview
The **Category-wise Focus Hours** chart on the Work Patterns page now includes a **Breaks** category, providing a complete view of how time is distributed throughout each hour of the day.

## What Changed

### Chart Enhancement
The stacked bar chart now displays **4 categories** instead of 3:

| Category | Icon | Color | Description |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Productive | 🎯 | Green (#4caf50) | Time on productive apps |
| Communication | 📞 | Blue (#2196f3) | Time on communication apps |
| Browsing | 🌐 | Purple (#9c27b0) | Time on browsers |
| **Breaks** | ☕ | **Orange (#ff9800)** | **Idle/break time (NEW)** |

### Visual Representation
- **Stacked bars** show all 4 categories per hour
- **Orange segment** at the top represents breaks/idle time
- **Interactive clicking** works on all 4 categories including Breaks

### Data Source
- Breaks data comes from `hourlySummary[].idleSec`
- Converted from seconds to minutes for display
- Matches the idle time tracking from the system

## Interactive Features

### Click on Breaks
When users click on the **☕ Breaks** segment in the chart:

**Dialog Shows:**
- **Break duration** for that specific hour
- **Informational message** explaining idle time
- **Educational tip** about the importance of breaks

**Example:**
```
☕ Breaks - 09:00

Idle/Break time during 09:00: 15 minutes

This represents time when no application activity was detected during this hour.

💡 About Breaks:
Breaks are essential for productivity and health. Regular breaks help maintain focus and prevent burnout.
```

### Click on Other Categories
Clicking on Productive, Communication, or Browsing shows:
- List of applications active in that hour
- Focus time for each application
- Sorted by most to least time

## Code Changes

### 1. Data Function Updated
```javascript
const getCategoryFocusPerHourData = () => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  const breaksData = activityData.hourlySummary.map(h => 
    Math.round((h.idleSec || 0) / 60)
  );

  return {
    labels: hours,
    datasets: [
      { label: '🎯 Productive', ... },
      { label: '📞 Communication', ... },
      { label: '🌐 Browsing', ... },
      { label: '☕ Breaks', data: breaksData, backgroundColor: '#ff9800', ... }
    ]
  };
};
```

### 2. Click Handler Enhanced
```javascript
const handleCategoryFocusClick = (event, elements) => {
  const categoryLabels = ['🎯 Productive', '📞 Communication', '🌐 Browsing', '☕ Breaks'];
  const categoryKeys = ['Productive', 'Communication', 'Browsers', 'Breaks'];
  
  // Special handling for Breaks
  if (categoryKey === 'Breaks') {
    setSelectedCategoryFocusData({
      hour: hour,
      category: clickedCategory,
      apps: [],
      isBreaks: true,
      idleMinutes: Math.round((hourData?.idleSec || 0) / 60)
    });
  } else {
    // Handle other categories with app lists
  }
};
```

### 3. Dialog Updated
```javascript
<DialogContent>
  {selectedCategoryFocusData?.isBreaks ? (
    // Show break time info
    <Box>
      <Typography>Idle/Break time: {idleMinutes} minutes</Typography>
      <Box>💡 About Breaks: ...</Box>
    </Box>
  ) : (
    // Show app list for other categories
  )}
</DialogContent>
```
