## Benefits of This Layout

### ✅ Better Visual Flow
- Charts and visualizations grouped together
- Activity feed serves as a summary footer
- User sees analytics first, then current status

### ✅ Logical Organization
- Top: Overview metrics
- Middle: Data visualizations & charts
- Bottom: Real-time status update

### ✅ Page Scanning Pattern
- Users can review all analytics first
- Real-time feed becomes a "what's happening now" summary at the end
- Natural reading flow from general to specific

### ✅ Scrolling Behavior
- Important charts remain visible in viewport
- Activity feed accessible when user scrolls down
- Last thing users see before leaving the page

---

## Technical Implementation

### Grid Item Configuration
```javascript
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <Paper sx={{ p: 2 }}>
    <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
      Real-time Activity Feed
    </Typography>
    <Box sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      {/* Activity feed content */}
    </Box>
  </Paper>
</Grid>
```

### Positioning
- Full width grid item (`xs={12}`)
- Positioned at the end of the main Grid container
- Comment marker: `{/* Real-time Activity Feed - Last Component */}`

### Dependencies
- Uses same helper functions:
  - `getFocusedWindow()`
  - `getCurrentAppsCount()`
  - `getMonitoringHours()`
  - `getTotalMemoryUsage()`
  - `getProductivityScore()`
  - `formatMemory()`

---

## Code Location

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js`

**Lines:** ~915-973 (approximate, after all chart components)

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
Dashboard
└── Box (main container)
    └── Grid container
        ├── Metric Cards
        ├── AI Suggestions
        ├── Charts (various)
        └── Real-time Activity Feed ← Last child
```
